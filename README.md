# IT313 Laboratory 6: Student Directory Viewer

## Project Description

The Student Directory Viewer is a mobile application developed using React Native and Expo. It allows academic advisers to view and search for students who need academic advising.

The application displays student profiles, including their photos, names, and year levels. It also allows advisers to flag students who need advising.

## Objectives

- Create a student directory using React Native core components.
- Display student information using View, Text, and Image.
- Implement a scrollable student list using ScrollView.
- Add a search feature using TextInput.
- Handle user interaction using Pressable.

## Component Structure

### StudentCard

The StudentCard component displays an individual student's information. It receives the student's ID, name, year level, photo URL, flagged status, and toggle function through props.

### StudentDirectory

The StudentDirectory component manages the student data and search query using React state. It filters students based on the search input and displays each student using the StudentCard component.
